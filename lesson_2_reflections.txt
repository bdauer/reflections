What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository creates a .git file that tracks version histories.
	Now the directory in which the git init command was used is treated as a
	git repository and one can use git's version control with the project.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is the place where work done in the working directory is stored
	prior to a commit. The commit adds it to the repository. By having a staging area,
	one can work and modify one's work across multiple files, and save those files,
	without creating a commit. This means that it's easier to experiment without
	breaking something and the commit log is kept neater.
